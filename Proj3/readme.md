# Project 3 Hawks & Doves:

## Hawks, doves, and flocks.

For this project we give you a choice of two different projects to work on. They both involve using object orientation to build a simulation of creatures and to model their behavior. In the first option, you will build a classic “hawk and dove” simulation. This will have you evolving creatures that compete for food, and you will reproduce the remarkable discovery that, in such a competition, two distinct creature “strategies” are successful. The second instead has you modeling a flock of creatures that live and move in a (two-dimensional) world. You will see that we can give each creature simple goals for their movement, and yet a complex collective behavior can result, one that mimics the movement of a group of animals.

## Option 1: Hawks & Doves

In this project you will be simulating a small ecosystem. In this ecosystem birds of various species look for food. Sometimes they find it and eat it. Other times they find it, but so does another bird. The birds then have the choice to fight for the food or to be passive. Depending on their decisions, they could get the food or not, but they could also be injured in the fight. You will create different species of birds with varying behaviors and see how those species thrive (or not) in certain situations.

The scenarios you’ll be investigating here are commonly talked about in a variety of fields. We’ll be focusing on the programming, but there are lots of important ideas here, and the analysis of this sort of situation is of interest to biologists, economists, mathematicians, and others. Computer simulation is only one way to go about thinking about these issues, but it is a tool that can add help greatly with this analysis (and with more complicated scenarios of a similar type).

## Personal Notes

[Project Link](https://jimfix.github.io/csci121/assign/project3/hawkdove.html)

I am making a few tweeks to how the project is structured, just because I have the time and think it's good form.

1. Settings.py is now a file that can modify speficic settings for a world. This way multiple simulations can be run one after another (something that realistically would be done in the real world).

2. Hawkdove.py is being reconstructed into main.py
